  <p class="mb-6 text-xl md:text-2xl uppercase">Hamilton: An American Musical is a sung- and rapped-through musical about the life of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, with music, lyrics, and book by Lin-Manuel Miranda, inspired by the 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton by historian Ron Chernow.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">The musical Hamilton opened in London on 6 December 2017, at the refurbished Victoria Palace Theatre, allowing British theatre-goers finally to experience this global phenomenon.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">But the story of that immigrant – Hamilton himself, who was born on the Caribbean island of Nevis – is not all backroom manoeuvring. It has dramatic highs and lows, taking in revolution, a sex scandal, blackmail and death in a duel at the hands of the US vice-president.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg">Hamilton was an orphan, born out of wedlock to a half-British/half-French mother, who died when he was about 11, and a Scottish father, who had long since abandoned them. His mother was still married to another man, and her estranged husband emerged after her death to seize her estate, leaving young Alexander penniless.</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-lg"> So how did Hamilton make his way? As a teenage clerk, he showed such prowess in writing about a hurricane that struck the island of Christiansted that a group of elders teamed up to send him to King’s College (now Columbia University) in New York. Once there, however, he set his heart on achieving glory in the War of Independence and was soon captaining an artillery division, before becoming aide-de-camp to General George Washington, a non-combat role. But Hamilton insisted on returning to action, and in the last major battle of the war, he led a bayonet charge against besieged British forces in 1781 at Yorktown, Virginia (now about seven hours’ drive from New York), which led to the decisive surrender of General Cornwallis’s army.</p>

  Hamilton is already one of the most successful Broadway musicals ever, but the majority of its most ardent fans have never actually seen it. Since it opened in New York in 2015, the show – a hip-hop musical about the life of American founding father Alexander Hamilton and the American revolution – has sold out its whole run, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and was nominated for a record-breaking 16 Tony awards, eventually winning 11. Now it's opened in the West End, British fans are finally getting their shot to see the show. </p>
 <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
  Hamilton employs a cast of non-white actors to tell the story of the founding of America in a way that looks very different from conventional history textbooks.</p>
